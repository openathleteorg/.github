### 🎯 Our Mission

The fitness industry is dominated by walled gardens. Your health data is locked away, and advanced coaching features are behind expensive paywalls.

**OpenAthlete** changes the game. We are building the first **community-driven, AI-enhanced training ecosystem** that puts the athlete in control.

* **🔓 Open & Transparent:** Auditable code. No hidden algorithms.
* **🏠 Privacy First:** Self-hostable via Docker. Your health data stays yours.
* **🤖 AI for Everyone:** Advanced planning and injury prediction powered by BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) AI models.
